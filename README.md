# Welcome Dear hiring manager,

### I did the task to the fullest. I wish you would appreciate my effort in producing this work.

A Simple Demo-App built to demonstrate the use of Modern Android development tools - (Java, RxJava, Hilt-Dependency Injection, MVVM, Material Design Components).
## Architecture
MVVM is pretty good in such cases. It goes one step further in separating the responsibilities of your code base. It clearly abstracts the logic of the actions that can be performed in the app.

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) 100% Java-only.
- [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Dependency Injection framework
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java
- [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - View Binding
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - Log
- Following MVVM Architectural Design Pattern
- [Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material Design
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel): Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata): Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
- [Lombok](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok/): Android development with lombok is easy and won't make your android application any 'heavier' because lombok is a compile-time only library
- OOP specifically professional use of inheritance
- Swipe Refresh Layout
- Circle ImageView
- ProgressBar
- Glide
- interceptor, okhttpClient
- and more

## Important Note 
#### If you see the code as red like errors, you should know it works, but you should add [Lombok](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok/) plugin
